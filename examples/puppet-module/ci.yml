# Workflow execution flow:
#
# On develop branch:
#   1. validate runs → checks all lint/syntax/tests
#
# On PR to develop or main:
#   1. validate runs → checks all lint/syntax/tests
#
# On push to main (merge from develop):
#   1. validate runs → checks all lint/syntax/tests
#   2. If validate passes → release runs:
#      - semantic-release analyzes commits
#      - determines new version
#      - updates metadata.json
#      - generates/updates CHANGELOG.md
#      - creates GitHub Release
#      - commits changes back to main
